# CalorimeterSim

This repository contains code developed to simulate a lead glass calorimeter using **Geant4**, a toolkit for the simulation of particle interactions with matter. This work supports the efforts of the [EMPHATIC collaboration](https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2019/pub/fermilab-pub-19-625-nd.pdf) to enhance hadron interaction data for future neutrino experiments.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to model and analyze the performance of a lead glass calorimeter. These simulations contribute to the EMPHATIC collaborationâ€™s mission of providing precise hadron interaction data, improving the accuracy of neutrino flux predictions in future neutrino experiments.

## Features

- **Simulation Toolkit**: Utilizes Geant4 for modeling particle-matter interactions.
- **Calorimeter Design**: Simulates a lead glass calorimeter setup, focusing on energy deposition and particle tracking.
- **Customizable**: Includes macros for running and visualizing the simulation with adjustable parameters.
